Inline Image Resize



It is sometimes convenient to resize an image as they are read. Suppose you have hundreds of large JPEG images you want to convert to a sequence of PNG thumbails:

magick "*.png" -resize 120x120 thumbnail%03d.png



Here all the images are read and subsequently resized. It is faster and less resource intensive to resize each image it is read:

magick "*.png[120x120]" thumbnail%03d.png
